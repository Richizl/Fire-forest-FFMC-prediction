The aim of this project is to implement a simple Linear Regression algorithm in parameters of a chosen dataset, in this case the fire forests data set. 

Basically the program predicts the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)  which denotes the moisture content surface litter and influences ignition and fire spread.

The program implements the Linear regression over the temperature and the FFMC features (the ones with the highest correlation) by training the model with the training set, and evaluates the coefficient of determination by comparing the training data with the test data.
The program allows users to make predictions in the command window by using the temperature as input.
